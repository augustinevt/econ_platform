        "body": "Many artists are motivated their vision by shaping resources at hand into a satisfying representation of that vision. Many artists struggle by not knowing how to pull this off, as well as not knowing what the balance between staying true to vision and allowing physical/circumstantial constraints to affect the final output. Unfortunately, this conflict is often what holds people from fulfilling any of their artistic impulses. 1) the vision is too precious, 2) control over it's perception, 3) control over your feeling about the process and final product, 4) comfort in it's theoretical perfection, 5) fear of misrepresentationthere is a closed loop if you fall in love with the perfection in you own vision. If you do not risk the mutation of your vision, you will shun it as compromise. Breaking the loop requires breaking out of the self containing system in which you have invested your emotion, in the form of you vision. This is the rationale for the obnoxious advice often given to careful people, 'just do it'. Breaking the self referencing, containing impulses of the impetus of your effort may be similar to striking thru the gordian knot, reliving the contrived circumstances that doom your projects to confinement"

      "body": "Maybe there is a good reason for the protection the core puts up around itself. Maybe the core protects identity because without it, people find it difficult to function. History, changing. Maybe the the 'billowing complexity' is actually the waxing of identity, and giving it up is something to be extremely careful about. Maybe the cycle is what gives richness and complexity to the works of art that conflicted individuals labor over, forcing out the most desperate purified expression that an audience forced to compromise in society craves. There is much to be gained by engaging in the loop, in the self referencing loop. It produces intricate and beautiful abstractions, consistency, identity of a certain kind. However, to me at least, I feel like accepting the benefits of the loop is not enough if it means also accepting the constraints."

      "body": "Clearly, there is the possibility to create interaction between the two forces that comprise the concept of the gordian knot: the mysterious tangle produces the aesthetic, rich and intuitive identity of the inherent self while sword is another source of identity, one linked to change, growth,  the identity of the will. My recommendation is that we accept the valididty of both sources of identity and accept the roles they play in our lives. Those inclined may even leverage the understaning of their interaction to produce identities that capitalize on the mysterious beauty and profundity we all inherit in the deep of the human psyche in orchestration with the generally perceived heroism of self determinism."
